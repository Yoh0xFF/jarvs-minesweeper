You can play the game [here](https://yoh0xff.github.io/jarvs-minesweeper-host/).

## Description

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The game's objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden `mines` or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

## Gameplay

A game of Minesweeper begins when the player makes the first click on a board with all cells unopened. This click is guaranteed to be safe. During the game, the player uses information from the opened cells to deduce other cells that are safe to open, iteratively gaining more knowledge to solve the board. The player is also given the number of remaining mines on the board, known as the mine count. It is calculated as the total number of mines subtracted by the number of flagged cells.

To win the game, players must open all non-mine cells without opening any mines, and flagging all the mined cells is not required.

The `score` of the game is the time taken to complete it. The timer starts when the player makes their first click and ends when they make their last click.

## Sprite Sheet

I downloaded the game's sprite sheet from the [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/minesweeper/sheet/19849/) website, and the credits for `Winmine 31/NT and 2000+` resources go to [Black Squirrel](https://www.spriters-resource.com/submitter/Black+Squirrel/).
